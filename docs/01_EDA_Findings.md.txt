# **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Overview**

## **1.1 Dataset Scope and Origin**

This project utilizes a comprehensive repository of global development metrics, unifying data from major international organizations including the **World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, and FAOSTAT**. The dataset provides a longitudinal view of health, economic, and nutritional factors.

* **Temporal Coverage:** 1990 – 2019 (30-year span).

* **Geographical Scope:** 193 Countries.

* **Granularity:** Data is recorded by **Country**, **Year**, and **Gender** (Male, Female, Both Sexes).

* **Total Records:** A unified ETL process consolidated these sources into a single analytical structure.

# **1.2 Variable Breakdown**

The dataset is categorized into six high-level domains. Below is a summary of the key variables analyzed during the EDA phase.

### **A. Demographics & Vital Statistics**
Basic population structures and mortality indicators used to normalize health data across different nations.

| Variable Name  | Description|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Life Expectancy     | Average years a newborn is expected to live.    |
| Mortality Rates      | Specific rates for Infant (<1 yr), Under-5, Neonatal (first 28 days), and Maternal mortality (per 100k births).     |
| Population Structure     | Granular breakdown of age groups: 0-14, 15-64, and 65+. The elderly population is further segmented (65-69, 70-74, etc.) to analyze aging demographics.    |
| Birth/Death Rates    | Crude rates per 1,000 inhabitants, including adolescent birth rates (15-19 years).     |

### **B. The Target Variable: Cardiovascular Health**
The primary target for the prediction model is **% Death Cardiovascular.**

* **Definition:** The probability of dying from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases between ages 30 and 70.

* **Context:** This metric serves as the primary "Outcome" variable for the Health Policy Simulator, representing the efficacy of a population's health and diet.

### **C. Diet & Nutrition (Feature Richness)**
A critical component of this analysis is the granular breakdown of dietary habits, allowing for precise correlations between specific food groups and health outcomes.

* **Macronutrients:** Daily caloric intake split by **Animal Protein, Plant Protein, Fat**, and **Carbohydrates**.

* **Food Groups (Kcal/Day):** Detailed intake data for Sugar, Oils/Fats, Meat, Dairy, Starchy Roots, Pulses, and Cereals.

* **Specific Consumption (kg/year):**

    *  **Cereals:** Wheat, Rice, Maize, Barley, Rye, Oats.

    * **Fruits/Veg:** Vegetable consumption (kg), plus specific fruits like Bananas, Apples, Citrus, and Grapes.

### **D. Economic & Environmental Factors**
These variables serve as control features, distinguishing between healthcare outcomes driven by wealth vs. those driven by lifestyle.

* **Economic:** GDP per Capita, GNI, and Poverty Rates ($1.90, $3.20, $5.50 a day thresholds).

* **Government Spending:** Expenditure allocations for **Health, Education**, and **Military** as % of GDP/Total Expenditure.

* **Sanitation:** Access to basic drinking water, safe sanitation, and hand-washing facilities.

### **E. Healthcare System Capability**
Metrics evaluating the infrastructure available to treat conditions, separate from preventative lifestyle factors.

* **Workforce:** Density of Doctors, Nurses/Midwives, Dentists, and Pharmacists per 10,000 inhabitants.

* **Coverage:** Universal Health Care Coverage index (0-100 scale) and % of births attended by skilled personnel.

## **1.3 Key Analysis Findings**
During the Exploratory Data Analysis, several key characteristics of the data were identified which shaped the modeling strategy:

1. **Dietary Correlations:** Initial analysis suggests a strong divergence in **"Wheat" vs. "Rice"** consumption patterns based on geography, which correlates significantly with specific mortality clusters.

2. **The "Hidden" Sugar Risk:** While "Diet Calories Fat" is often high in developed nations, **"Diet Composition Sugar"** showed a more volatile relationship with the target variable, indicating it is a high-leverage feature for policy intervention.

3. **Data Completeness:** The "Unified Dataset" structure effectively minimized missing values for major economic powers, but required imputation strategies for developing nations in the early 1990s.

4. **Age Standardization:** The presence of Age Standardized mortality columns allows for fair comparison between countries with young populations (e.g., Nigeria) and aging populations (e.g., Japan), ensuring the model learns "Health Risk" rather than just "Old Age."

## **1.4 Conclusion**
The dataset provides a robust, multi-dimensional view of national health. The combination of macro-economic indicators with micro-nutritional data (down to the specific grain type) makes it uniquely improved for training a machine learning model capable of simulating complex health policy outcomes.

## **1.5 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning Strategy**
The preprocessing pipeline focused on maximizing data integrity by removing non-country aggregates and selecting high-density features rather than relying on heavy imputation.

### **A. Data Cleaning (Removing Aggregates)**
To prevent data leakage and duplication, non-country entities were removed from the dataset. Rows containing regional or economic aggregates (e.g., "World", "Europe", "High income countries") were filtered out, leaving only distinct country-level data.

## **B. Handling Missing Values (The "Column Selection" Strategy)**
Initial analysis revealed significant missingness in specific domains:

* **Excluded:** Socio-economic and lifestyle indicators like **Poverty Rates ($1.90/day)** and **Tobacco/Alcohol Prevalence** had missing rates exceeding 90-95%. Imputing these would have introduced significant noise.

* **Selected:** Nutritional (Diet Composition, Consumption) and Demographic features had near 40% missing values.

* **Decision:** The pipeline prioritized row volume (>10,000 observations) by dropping these sparse columns entirely, rather than dropping rows or attempting unreliable imputation.

### **C. Final Data Preparation**
* **Strict Filtering:** After selecting the 25 high-quality features, a strict dropna() operation was applied. This removed any remaining rows with incomplete data, ensuring the model was trained only on complete "ground truth" observations.

* **Feature Subset:** The final dataset was restricted to 25 core features across four categories:

   1. **Demographics:** Age structures (0-14, 15-64, 65+) and Gender.

   2. **Macronutrients:** Fat, Carbohydrates, Animal vs. Plant Protein.

   3. **Diet Composition:** Caloric breakdown by source (Sugar, Meat, Starchy Roots, etc.).

   4. **Specific Food Consumption:** Granular data on key staples (Wheat, Rice, Fruit types).

### **D. Outlier & Correlation Analysis**
* **The Wealth Paradox:** Correlation analysis revealed a counter-intuitive negative correlation between Sugar/Fat intake and Mortality. This was identified as a confounding variable (Wealthier nations eat more sugar but have better hospitals), confirming the need for **Non-Linear Models** (like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) that can handle these complex interactions better than linear regression.
